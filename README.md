# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

Here, you'll find a collection of data analysis projects that showcase my skills in analytics and data visualization. I utilize a variety of tools and libraries such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform comprehensive analyses and derive actionable insights. For data collection, I often use sources like Kaggle and employ web scraping techniques to gather relevant datasets. Below are some of the projects I have completed.
